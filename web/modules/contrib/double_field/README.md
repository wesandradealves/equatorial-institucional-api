# Double Field module

## Introduction

The Double Field module provides extensions to Drupal's core fields. With this
module you can split your fields up into two separate parts.

## Requirements

This module requires no modules outside of Drupal core.

## Installation

Install the Double Field module as you would normally install a contributed
Drupal module. Visit the [Installing Modules](https://www.drupal.org/node/1897420)
guide for further information.

## Configuration

1. Enable the Double Field module at Administration > Extend.
2. When creating a new field on a content type or custom entity type, choose
   "Double Field" from the drop-down menu.
3. On the Field Settings form for the Double Field, define the two subfields
   as you would with any other field.
4. Optionally, on the "Edit" form for the Double Field, you may choose
   options for whether the subfields are "required" or limit allowed values
   from the collapsible fieldsets "First subfield" and "Second subfield" at
   the bottom of the page.
5. Additional display options for the Double Field will be found under
   "Format settings" (gear icon) in the "Manage display" form.
